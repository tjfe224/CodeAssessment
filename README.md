# Code Assessment 
This code assessment is designed to showcase my knowledge of C++ for a position at GTRI
## Usage
Inside the CodeAssessment directory is a self-contained program named CodeAssessment.cpp that outputs all requested information. It has a main method, so it doesn't require other runners
## Testing
Since there wasn't a time crunch, I decided to also make unit tests for the program using Microsoft Visual Studioâ€™s CppUnitTestFramework. pch.h is included in the header and the file structure of the main program must be maintained unless manual editing of the imports is preferred.
## Notes
* Most knowledge of C++ was gained on my own which means implementation may not be in-line with typical language recommendations, but it still gets the job done
* I'm fine to make adjustments as needed if an issue is found of if I misread anything
* There are an excessive number of comments in CodeAssessment.cpp that can hopefully explain some reasoning as to why I did certain things in the code
